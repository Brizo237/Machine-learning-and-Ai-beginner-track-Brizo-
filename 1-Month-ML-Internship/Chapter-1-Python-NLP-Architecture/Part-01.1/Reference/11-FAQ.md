# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: When should I use classes vs functions?
A: Use classes for related data and behavior, functions for simple operations.

## Q: Are decorators required knowledge for ML?
A: No, but they're useful for logging, caching, and parameter validation.

## Q: What's the difference between generators and comprehensions?
A: Generators are lazy (memory efficient), comprehensions are eager.

## Q: How do I know if my code needs optimization?
A: Profile first! Don't guess. Use cProfile to identify bottlenecks.

## Q: What's the point of context managers?
A: Ensures resources are cleaned up (files closed, connections freed).

## Q: Can I combine decorators?
A: Yes! Stack them, but mind the order of execution.

## Q: How do custom exceptions help?
A: They make error handling clearer and more maintainable.

## Q: Is regex necessary for NLP?
