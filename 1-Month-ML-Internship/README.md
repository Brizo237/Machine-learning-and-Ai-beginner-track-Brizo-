# 1-Month Machine Learning Internship

**Program Duration:** 4 Weeks | **Daily Commitment:** 7+ Hours | **Level:** Foundational → Intermediate

---

## 🎯 Program Philosophy

Every concept is first **built from scratch** to develop true understanding. High-level libraries are **tools — not crutches**. Students leave this program knowing the **math**, the **code**, and the **craft**.

**Focus:** *"Algorithm Intuition"* — Building logic from scratch before using high-level libraries.
